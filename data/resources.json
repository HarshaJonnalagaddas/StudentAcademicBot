    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right college major?",
      "answer": "Choosing a major involves considering your interests, strengths, career goals, and market demand. Start by taking career assessments, researching different fields, talking to professionals, and considering your long-term goals. Remember that many successful people change careers, so your major doesn't necessarily limit your future options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What GPA do I need for college admission?",
      "answer": "GPA requirements vary significantly by institution. Highly competitive schools typically require 3.8+ GPAs, while many good colleges accept students with 3.0-3.5 GPAs. However, admissions are holistic - test scores, extracurriculars, essays, and recommendations also matter significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I start preparing for college applications?",
      "answer": "Ideally, start planning in 9th grade by taking challenging courses and getting involved in activities. Begin serious preparation in 11th grade, including standardized test prep and college research. Start applications in the summer before senior year, with deadlines typically between November and January."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I make college more affordable?",
      "answer": "Consider in-state public universities, community colleges for first two years, merit scholarships, need-based financial aid, work-study programs, and applying to schools known for generous aid. Complete the FAFSA early and research scholarship opportunities specific to your background or interests."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between the SAT and ACT?",
      "answer": "The SAT focuses more on reasoning and problem-solving, while the ACT is more curriculum-based. The SAT has sections in Math, Reading, and Writing & Language, while the ACT includes English, Math, Reading, Science, and an optional Writing section. Most colleges accept both, so choose based on your strengths."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important are extracurricular activities?",
      "answer": "Extracurriculars are very important for competitive colleges as they demonstrate leadership, commitment, and interests beyond academics. Quality matters more than quantity - showing sustained involvement and leadership in a few activities is better than minimal participation in many."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I take AP or dual enrollment classes?",
      "answer": "Both can be beneficial. AP classes are standardized and widely recognized, with the potential for college credit through exams. Dual enrollment provides actual college credits and experience. Choose based on availability, your learning style, and how well the courses align with your academic goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if I'm unsure about my career path?",
      "answer": "It's normal to be unsure! Take career assessments, explore different fields through internships or job shadowing, talk to professionals in various industries, and consider a liberal arts education that provides broad skills. Many successful people changed careers multiple times."
